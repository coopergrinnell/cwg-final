              <h3>Monstro</h3>
              <p>A hopping, hulking, grinning mass of a monster, he leaps high into the air and slams back down on top of you, and spits up groups of bullets to dodge when on the ground. He is an early boss, and a good teacher of how challenging a boss monster can be compared to the simple floor monsters of the area just previously cleared.</p>      
            </div>
            <div class="blog2">
              <h3>Chub</h3>
              <p>A massive vissage of a maggot perverted into a happy-go-lucky look willing to charge you down and bite you in half. This boss teaches you how to stick and move, dodge and weave, and deal with the extra smaller enemies he calls in to help in the middle of the fight.</p>      
            </div>
            <div class="blog3">
              <h3>The Dark One</h3>
              <p>The embodyment of evil, a vissage of the devil himself but only that, a vissage and name on a lesser demon. The Dark One and his counterpart The Adversary both offer similar fights consisting of floating about the room, flying through walls, and spitting bullets to dodge. a higher challenge that some, but a healthy one at that.</p>      
            </div>
            <div class="blog4">
              <h3>Little Horn</h3>
              <p>A cute little demon, clearly just a baby trying to impress his elders. Floating aimlessly about the room, spitting large floating orbs to destroy, and opening rifts in reality to fall into and teleport around the room, he is as dangerous as he is cute.</p>      
            </div>
            <div class="blog5">
              <h3>Pin</h3>
              <p>One of, if not the easiest bosses in the game, and barely a challenge at all until about 4 are introduced into any given room. Nothing more than a big worm bounding about the room at you to attack and spitting a bullet or two at you to lamely and fruitlessly trying to fight back.</p>
