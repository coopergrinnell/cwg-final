              <h3>Gaper</h3>
              <p>A horrifying face all too familiar, streaked with blood and smiling like a demon sighting his prey. The Gaper is a common enemy throughout the entirerty of the game, running toard you to damage you on touch. Be careful in attacking them as their head may take the brunt of the damage and be taken first spurting bullets from the headless neck.</p>      
            </div>
            <div class="blog2">
              <h3>Mulligan</h3>
              <p>The Mulligan is a funny one, a lumpy mishapen pinata of a boy, they can be filled with all manner of goodies from flies to bombs. You will have to chase them down to attack them as they will run from you and eventually explode into new baddies to fight.</p>      
            </div>
            <div class="blog3">
              <h3>The Host</h3>
              <p>The classic whack-a-mole enemy of the game, an undamageable skill top with a soft fleshy underbelly spitting bullets at you leaving itself open and vulnerable to attack. These and their completely flesh made counterparts, the Red Hosts, are dangerous and can be annoying to deal with if the proper technique is not employed.</p>      
            </div>
            <div class="blog4">
              <h3>The Fly</h3>
              <p>The most basic, versitile, and classic of all enemies standing in your path to redemption and glory. The basic black fly is little more than a floating target to shoot, dealing no damage and only existing to make your life more dificult. other varients, some named some only titled, will follow you through the entire journey seeing you through to the end.</p>      
            </div>
            <div class="blog5">
              <h3>The Globin</h3>
              <p>One of the more horrifying enemies of the depths, looking like a skinned and flayed body running at you relentlessly, melting into a pile of goop when damaged enough only to reform and run you down again and again until the goop is destroyed.</p>
